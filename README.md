This repo contains a few files related to setup scripts for the Raleigh Iron Yard Java class.

The Install Party lesson contains provides students with a command they can run in Terminal. It downloads and executes the `install_everything.sh` script. The student's ID is pulled from Newline using the `extractStudentId.js` and adds this as an argument to the command shown.

The install script will download the `IntelliJ_Config.zip` file and extract it into the users `~/Library` directory to setup IntelliJ.
